# arkworks nlookup

An implementation of the [nlookup protocol](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/573.pdf) as a R1CS circuit (that is, the nlookup verifier is made noninteractive and expressed as R1CS) that incorporates hybrid tables and projection optimizations as described [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1886.pdf). We use the [arkworks](https://github.com/arkworks-rs) library to write R1CS.
